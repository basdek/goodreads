# Goodreads assignment project

V 0.1.0-snapshot

## Setup and testing

* The unit tests require the seed json files and a working mongo instance to test 
against.

* Currently there is no infra to delete the data the tests write. 

## General

* The project is sprinkled with TODO's varying from a "nice to have" to 
"do beware, not ready to use in production, shortcuts taken due to time constraints."
